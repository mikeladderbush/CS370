# CS370

In the following project I was given a framework of a simple game where an agent starts at certain location on a grid and has to learn to find the treasure elsewhere on the grid.
The part of the code that I developed was the Q learning section that allowed the agent to learn the best strategies over time.
I think that making use of systems like this in the future will be effective in solving many problems. I think that part of being a computer scientist is understanding the proper
time and place to implement these types of algorithms and knowing the strengths and weaknesses of different tools for different jobs. In terms of ethical concerns I think that it is my responsibility as a computer scientist and software engineer to understand the possibility of abuse that could be found in systems I contribute too as well as knowing that AI needs to be guided properly in order to avoid biases.
